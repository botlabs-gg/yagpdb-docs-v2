# YAGPDB Docs v2

Experimental / Proof of Concept page to replace the current documentation which is built with GitBook.

This page is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in conjunction with the
[Relearn theme](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/) as an experiment to see if it is a viable alternative.

## Contributing / Building

As always clone the repository first and change into it.

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), clone this repository and run `hugo server` to start a
local server. The server will automatically rebuild the page when you make changes.

To build the page in release mode:

1. `hugo mod vendor`
2. `hugo`

Then serve the generated `public/` directory with the webserver of your choice. Adjust the `--baseURL` argument to
`hugo` as required.

For more information, please view our [Contributing Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Editor Setup

As this project used the [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) standard, you will have to make sure that your
editor supports it. Most modern editors do, but if you are unsure, check the EditorConfig page.

### Adding a new page

Please read the Relearn theme's [documentation](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn) for a full guide as well
as its Markdown syntax.
