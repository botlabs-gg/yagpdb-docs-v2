# Enable all rules; we'll configure some of them below.
default: true

# MD001: Header levels should only increment by one level at a time.
# Normally, this is a fair rule, but it does not quite work for our cases,
# especially in our humongous functions list. So disable it.
MD001: false

# MD002: First header should be a top level header.
# Some files do not have a top-level header, because it doesn't make sense for
# them, or just looks incredibly stupid on the rendered page. So disable this
# entire rule.
MD002: false

# MD004: Unordered list style.
# Use dashes for unordered lists. All lists. Even sublists.
MD004:
  style: "dash"

# MD010: Hard tabs.
# ALlow hard tabs in code blocks, but not in normal text.
MD010:
  code_blocks: false

# MD013: Line length.
# Allow lines to be up to 120 characters long, see the .editorconfig file.
# We also ignore code blocks, because they are often long and should not be
# wrapped at all. Same goes for tables.
MD013:
  line_length: 120
  code_blocks: false
  tables: false

# MD024: Multiple headers with the same content.
# Allow multiple headers with the same content so long they are under different
# parent headers.
MD024:
  siblings_only: true

# MD026: Trailling punctuation in header.
# Allow question marks (FAQ-style).
MD026:
  punctuation: ".,;:!"

# MD029: Ordered list item prefix.
# Should increase in numerical order.
MD029:
  style: "ordered"

# MD033: Inline HTML.
# Allow certain HTML elements, because we use them for nicer page layout.
MD033:
  allowed_elements: ["center", "div", "sup", "br", "kbd"]

# MD037: Spaces inside emphasis markers.
# This rule is broken. See https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/issues/84
MD037: false

# MD041: First line in file should be a top-level header.
# See comment to MD002. It makes no sense to set this to H2 for similar reasons,
# we have TOML frontmatter with an automatic h1 in the rendered page.
MD041: false

# MD048: Code fence style.
# Use backticks for code fences.
MD048:
  style: "backtick"

# MD049: Emphasis style. (Italics)
# Use asterisks for italics.
# MD049:
#  style: "asterisk"
#  FIXME: Re-enable this rule once we have fixed all the italics in the docs.
MD049: false

# MD050: Strong style.
# Use double asterisks for bold text.
MD050:
  style: "asterisk"

# MD051: Link fragments should be valid.
# Disable this rule, because Hugo already checks for (potentially) broken links.
MD051: false

# MD052: Reference links and images should use a label that is defined.
# Similar reasons as MD051, Hugo already checks for broken links.
MD052: false

# MD053: Link and image reference definitions should be needed.
# Similar reasons as MD051, Hugo already checks for broken links.
MD053: false

# MD054: Link and image style.
# Disable this rule, because it is very extensive and thus painful to configure.
# By extension, also very painful to fix.
MD054: false
