> Documentation is for users. - Rob Pike

This is the documentation for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz); this document in its current form is a work in progress, as
it is an attempt to move away from the current documentation hosted via GitBook.

This page is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in conjunction with the
[Relearn theme](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/) as an experiment to see if it is a viable alternative.

## Other Resources

### Support Server

If you need help with YAGPDB, please join the [support server](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5) and ask in the appropriate
channel. Any other online forum is not official and should be generally treated as inaccurate.

Questions regarding the clarity of this documentation are also welcome, as they help us improve the documentation.

Remember to first read `#information` and `#faq` before asking questions. Our support staff are volunteers, so please be
patient when they don't respond in 10<sup>-3</sup> seconds, they are probably busy with something else.

### Learning Center

This page is also a work in progress, and can be found at [learn.yagpdb.xyz](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz). It is a more
step-by-step guide to get you started with YAGPDB's custom command system and is less in-your-face than the
documentation.

However, it is not a replacement for the documentation, so you will need to read both to actually write custom commands.
