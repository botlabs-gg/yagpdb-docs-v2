Custom commands (abbreviated **CCs**) allow you to develop your own commands and behaviors for your server. A command
may be as simple as an autoresponder or employ a more complex system. A variety of triggers are available for custom
commands and the custom template script provides a wide array of templates and functions for coding advanced commands.
