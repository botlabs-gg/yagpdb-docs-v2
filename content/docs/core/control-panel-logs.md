View a list of recent changes to your YAGPDB configuration.

<!--more-->

This page is the analogue of the audit log built in to Discord for YAGPDB settings and summarizes recent edits on the
control panel, listing the time, action, and responsible user for each. It is useful to audit who may be responsible if
things go haywire, but other than that this page is unlikely to be of use.

Please do not be confused if you see changes from the user `destroy_0001` (ID `598900258579283976`), as that is the bot
developer and he may at times need to change certain settings to ensure proper operation.
