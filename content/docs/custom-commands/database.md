all database entries created by custom commands, allowing you to view details on or delete individual entries.

## Entries

### Entry ID

The ID is assigned by the system and unique within YAGPDB's database. The database page is sorted by descending ID. You
may search for a specific ID using the **Search Bar** (**11**) with ID **Query** (**10**).

### Created Timestamp

UTC timestamp of when the entry was created.

### Updated Timestamp

UTC timestamp of when the entry was updated. Increasing or setting a database value updates this timestamp.

### Expiry Timestamp

UTC timestamp of when the entry will expire. An expired entry will not be retrieved by database functions, but **will**
appear on the database page.

### User ID

The user-defined ID of the entry (does not have to be a user's ID, accepts any int64). You may search for a specific ID
using the **Search Bar** (**11**) with User ID **Query** (**10**).

### Key

The user-defined key of the entry. A key is a string, max 256 characters. You may search for a specific key using the
**Search Bar** (**11**) with Key **Query** (**10**).

### Value

The serialized value of the database entry.

### Size of Value

Size of the value in bytes. YAGPDB database entries have a max value size of 100 kB.

### Delete Entry

Deletes the individual entry after confirmation. You may only delete one entry at a time.

## Page Navigation

Navigates to the next or previous page of entries. Each page lists 100 entries at a time.

## Search Query

Dropdown selection of the type of value to search by. Available options are ID, User ID, and Key.

## Search Bar

Number or Text to match against database entries. Results will only include entries that exactly match the search
pattern.

When searching for a Key, the search query supports PostgreSQL patterns.

- `_` matches any single character.
- `%` matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

To search for any database entries whose Key contains `yagpdb`, use `%yagpdb%` as your search pattern.
