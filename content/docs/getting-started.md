## Adding The Bot

{{< callout info >}}

You need to have the **Manage Server** permission to add the bot to your server.

{{< /callout >}}

1. Go to <https://yagpdb.xyz/manage>
2. Click on _Login with Discord_ in the top-right corner
3. Authorize the application to know what servers you are in
4. Select the server you want to add the bot to in the dropdown menu

### First Steps

Before doing anything, you should first take a closer look at the Control Panel you just opened. It is the main
interface for configuring the bot, and is where you will spend most of your time. Visit a few subpages to get a feel for
the navigation and layout.

<!-- Yes, this is hacky. No, I don't know of a better way. -->
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 7px; margin-top: -10px;">

</div>

Afterward, visit the Commands tab (Core > Command settings) and make sure that the default prefix (`-`) does not
conflict with other bots you may have. Also make sure to enable all commands, such that you can actually use YAGPDB.

Try some commands! Something like `catfact` or `dadjoke`, to get the party going.
If those did not work, please read the FAQ on the support server.
