options.

<!--more-->

## Quick Intro

This page lists all the available triggers in the order as they appear on the control panel. Use the Table of Contents
in the top left corner of this page alongside your browser's search function to quickly navigate to the trigger you're
looking for.

### Trigger Logic

Only one trigger has to be met for a rule to trigger — that is, the triggers are combined according to the logical OR
operator.

### List of Triggers

Following is a list of all available triggers, in the order they appear on the control panel.

#### All caps

This trigger fires when a message exceeds a certain percentage of uppercase characters. Following parameters are
available:

- **Min number of all caps**<br>
    The minimum number of uppercase characters in the message for the trigger to fire. (Default: 3)

- **Percentage of all caps**<br>
    The percentage of uppercase characters in the message for the trigger to fire. (Default: 100%)

- **Also match visually similar characters**<br>
    Whether to also match visually similar characters. (Default: off)

Both *Min number of all caps* and *Percentage of all caps* have to be met for this trigger to fire.

#### Message mentions

This trigger will fire when a message exceeds the configured threshold for *unique* user `@mention`s.

- **Min number of mentions**<br>
    The minimum number of unique mentions in the message for the trigger to fire. (Default: 4)

#### Any link

This trigger will fire when a message contains *any* valid link.[^1]

For more fine-grained control, consider using the [Website denylist](#website-denylist) or
[Website allowlist](#website-allowlist) trigger.

<!-- footnotes -->

[^1]: The regular expression used to match links is the following:<br>
``(?i)([a-z\d]+:[//])([\w-._~:/?#\[\]@!$&'()*+,;%=]+(?:(?:\.[\w_-]+)+))([\w.,@?^=%&:/~+#-]*[\w@?^=%&/~+#-])``

[^2]: Under the hood, the bot will only check the last 1000 messages in the channel. If you have a high-traffic channel
in combination with an extremely long time frame, the bot could (theoretically) miss some messages.

[^3]: The RegEx engine used in YAGPDB is RE2. Some features are not supported, like lookaheads and lookbehinds. See
    [regex101](https://regex101.com/?flavor=golang) for some help with writing RE2-compatible regular expressions.
