Let everyone know that someone is currently streaming.


### Streaming Feed

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

There are currently some issues with the streaming announcement, and it may not always give the announcement. It will
however, always assign the streamer role.

{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout context="danger" title="Danger" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}

The streaming role will be **automatically removed** from a member that is not streaming if it is given manually, so be
careful! If YAGPDB is removing member's roles without apparent reason, this may well be the cause.

{{< /callout >}}

Steaming notification is triggered based on your Discord streaming status (When you go purple, AKA streaming). You can
either have announcements, be assigned the streaming role or both.

### **Announce Channel**

Choose the Channel that you want to bot to post the announcement in.

### Announcement Message

Write the message that you want the announcement to say. The streaming announcements accept most templates, but have
some additional special ones:

- `{{ .URL }}` outputs the URL of the stream.
- `{{ .Game }}` outputs the current game.
- `{{ .StreamTitle }}` outputs the stream title.
- `{{ .User.Username }}` outputs the Discord username of the person who is streaming.

### Game Regex

Use regex to filter out games to post announcements and assign roles for specific games.

### Currently Streaming Role

Assign this role to the people streaming.

### Whitelist role

Only assign a role and make announcement for the people with this role.

### Ignore role

Do not assign a role and make an announcement for people with this role.

### Stream Title Regex

Use regex to filter out streams based on the title of their stream.
