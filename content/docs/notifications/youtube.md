The bot requires at least the "Read Messages" and "Send Messages" permissions in the channel you want to post the feed
in.

## Adding a YouTube Feed

To add a new feed simply copy the channel URL from YouTube and paste it into the "Link" field under "Add New Feed" (you
may need to scroll down a bit); then select a channel to post it to. For a visual reference, please see the image below.

<center>

</center>

If you are unable to obtain a direct channel URL, similar to<br>
*<https://youtube.com/channel/UCuAXFkgsw1L7xaCfnd5JJOw>*, we also support the following URLs:

- Video links (<https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>)
- Shorts links (<https://youtube.com/shorts/pBZ_2pX_8mg>)
- Share links (<https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ>)
- Live links (<https://youtube.com/live/jfKfPfyJRdk>)
- Playlist links (<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEamUZtdyTMxwDNQ97Y7im8EwqRyht12R>)

Although we make an attempt at extracting the channel from usernames (<https://youtube.com/user/MontyPython>),
custom links (<https://youtube.com/c/Taskmaster>), and handles (<https://youtube.com/@TomScottGo>), these are not as
reliable as the links listed above, as we use the first result of a YouTube search to determine the channel via these
URLs.

If you find yourself having trouble adding a feed using these kinds of URLs, please try to use one of the links listed
above before asking for help in the [support server](/discord).

{{< callout context="caution" title="Warning: Maximum Number of Feeds" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

You cannot have more than 10 active YouTube feeds at a time (250 with [Premium](/docs/welcome/premium)). If you have
that many feeds active, you cannot add more until you disable at least one of those. That disabled excess feed will be
deleted once you add a new one.

## Configuring a YouTube Feed

During setup of a feed there are four more options you can configure, namely:

- mention `@everyone` in the announcement message
- mention a specific role
- also publish livestreams
- also publish shorts

{{< callout context="note" title="Note: Required Bot Permissions" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

The bot needs mention `@everyone` or "mention this role" permissions if you wish to mention everyone or a specific role
of your choosing.

{{< /callout >}}

You need not configure any of these ahead of time, you can always [edit the feed](#editing-a-youtube-feed) later.

## Editing a YouTube Feed

To edit a feed, scroll down further until you reach the "Current subscribed channels" section. There you will find a
list of all the feeds you have added.

!["Current subscribed channels" section to edit a YouTube feed](./youtube-edit-feed.png)

Going from left to right of the editable options, you can change the following:

- The Discord channel to post to
- Mention `@everyone` in the announcement message
- Mention a specific role
- Also publish livestreams
- Also publish shorts
- Disable the feed until you enable it again

Once you have made your changes, click the "Save" button on the far right to save your changes. If you instead wish to
delete the feed, click the "Delete" button just below the "Save" button. None of these options need to be equal across
all your feeds, you can have different settings for each feed.

You can only save changes to a feed one at a time, so if there are multiple feeds you wish to edit, you have to do so
separately, saving after each feed you edited.

## Custom Announcement

If you take a look at the top-right of the configuration page, you'll see a field for custom command templates for usage
in the announcement message provided for YouTube feeds. The default response is the following code:

```yag
{{.ChannelName}} published a new video! {{.URL}}
```

You can customize this message to your liking, but bear in mind that using a custom announcement message will override
the default announcement's mention settings *for all channels*, therefore you will have to implement this logic by
yourself. Refer to the [mentions functions](https://help.yagpdb.xyz/docs/reference/templates/functions/#mentions) for
more information.

{{< callout context="danger" title="Danger: Custom Announcement Overrides Settings" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}

Using a custom announcement message will override the default announcement's mention settings for all channels. Really.
