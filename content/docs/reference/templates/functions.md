Functions are used to take action within template scripts. Some functions accept arguments, and some functions return
values you can send in your response or use as arguments for other functions.

----

## Channel

These functions relate to channels and threads.

{{< callout context="tip" title="Tip: Current Channel or Thread" icon="outline/rocket" >}}

Unless specified otherwise, these functions accept an ID, name, or `nil` for their thread or channel argument.

{{< /callout >}}

#### addThreadMember

```yag
{{ addThreadMember <thread> <member> }}
```

Adds a member to an existing thread. Does nothing if either argument is invalid.

#### closeThread

```yag
{{ closeThread <thread> <lock> }}
```

Closes the given thread.

- `lock`: whether to also lock the thread. Default `false`.

#### createForumPost

```yag
{{ $post := createForumPost <channel> <name> <content> [values] }}
```

Creates a new forum post. Returns a channel object on success.

- `channel`: the forum channel to post to.
- `name`: The post title. May not be empty. Must be a string.
- `content`: the initial message's content; may be a string, an embed, or a complex message. May not be empty.
- `values` (optional): Additional options for the post. May include:
  - `"slowmode"`: The thread's slowmode in seconds.
  - `"tags"`: One or more forum tag name or ID. Duplicate and invalid tags are ignored.


#### createThread

```yag
{{ $thread := createThread <channel> <messageID> <name> [private] [auto_archive_duration] [invitable] }}
```

Creates a new thread in the specified channel. Returns a channel object on success.

- `channel`: the parent channel to create the thread in.
- `message`: either `nil` to create a channel thread, or a message ID to create a message thread.
- `private`: whether the thread is private. Default `false`.
- `auto_archive_duration`: how long the thread will show in the channel list after inactivity.<br>
   Valid values are 60, 1440, 4320, and 10080 minutes. Defaults to 10080 (7 days).
- `invitable`: whether non-moderators can add other members to the thread. (true/false)

Note: There is no functional difference between a channel thread and a message thread.

Because the optional arguments are positional, you must provide the preceding ones if you wish to override a later
option. Consider the following example to create a public thread in the current channel with no message reference that
is archived after an hour and allows non-moderators to add others:

```yag
{{ createThread nil nil "new thread" false 60 true }}
```

#### deleteForumPost

```yag
{{ deleteForumPost <post> }}
```

Deletes the given forum post.

This function is functionally the same to [deleteThread](#deletethread).
Use whichever function is semantically more meaningful in the context of your custom command.

#### deleteThread

```yag
{{ deleteThread <thread> }}
```

Deletes the given thread.

This function is functionally the same to [deleteForumPost](#deleteforumpost).
Use whichever function is semantically more meaningful in the context of your custom command.

{{< callout context="caution" title="Caution: Storing Numerical Values" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}

Numerical values are stored as floating-point numbers in the database; large numbers such as user IDs will lose
precision. To avoid this, convert them to a string before writing to the database.

Numerical `dict` keys are retrieved as an `int64`, therefore you'd have to write<br>
`{{ $dict.Get (toInt64 N)}}` to retrieve the value associated with the numerical key `N`.

{{< /callout >}}

----

## Encoding and Decoding

#### decodeBase64

```yag
{{ $decoded := decodeBase64 <string> }}
```

Undoes the transformation performed by [`encodeBase64`](#encodebase64), converting the base64-encoded `string` back to
its original form.


#### encodeBase64

```

Returns the escaped value of the textual representation of the arguments in a form suitable for embedding in a URL
query.

----

## Executing Custom Commands

These functions enable you to execute a custom command within an already running custom command.

#### cancelScheduledUniqueCC

```yag
{{ cancelScheduledUniqueCC <ccID> <key> }}
```

Cancels a previously scheduled custom command execution using [scheduleUniqueCC](#scheduleuniquecc).

#### execCC

```yag
{{ execCC <ccID> <channel> <delay> <data> }}
```

Executes another custom command specified by `ccID`.

- `ccID`: the ID of the custom command to execute.
- `channel`: the channel to execute the custom command in. May be `nil`, a channel ID, or a channel name.
- `delay`: the delay in seconds before executing the custom command.
- `data`: some arbitrary data to pass to the executed custom command.

Calling `execCC` with 0 delay sets `.StackDepth` to the current recursion depth and limits it to 2.

##### Example

The following example showcases a custom command executing itself.

```yag
{{ if .ExecData }}
  {{ sendMessage nil (print "Executing custom command... Got data: " .ExecData) }}
  {{ return }}
{{ end }}

{{ sendMessage nil "Starting up..." }}
{{ execCC .CCID nil 5 "Hello, world!" }}
```

#### scheduleUniqueCC

```yag
{{ scheduleUniqueCC <ccID> <channel> <delay> <key> <data> }}
```

Schedules a custom command execution to occur in the future, identified by `key`.

- `ccID`: the ID of the custom command to execute.
- `channel`: the channel to execute the custom command in. May be `nil`, a channel ID, or a channel name.
- `delay`: the delay in seconds before executing the custom command.
- `key`: a unique key to identify the scheduled custom command.
- `data`: some arbitrary data to pass to the executed custom command.

To cancel such a scheduled custom command before it runs, use [cancelScheduledUniqueCC](#cancelscheduleduniquecc).

## Interactions

{{< callout context="tip" title="Tip" icon="outline/rocket" >}}

Use of interactions within YAGPDB is an advanced topic; the documentation should be used only as reference. To learn
about using interactions, [see here](/docs/reference/custom-interactions).

{{< /callout >}}

### Interaction Responses

- Only one interaction response may be sent to each interaction.
- If you do not send an interaction response, members will see "This application did not respond" on Discord.
- You may only send an interaction response to the interaction which triggered the command.
- Text output directly to the response is automatically sent as an interaction response if the interaction hasn't
  already been responded to.
- A CC executed with `execCC` by the triggered CC will be able to send initial responses to the triggering interaction.
- A response is not the same thing as a followup.

#### sendModal

```yag
{{ sendModal <modal> }}
```

Sends a modal to the member who triggered the interaction.

- `modal`: an sdict with the following keys:
  - `title`: the title of the modal.
  - `custom_id`: a unique identifier for the modal.
  - `fields`: a slice of sdicts with the following keys:
    - `label`: the label for the field.
    - `placeholder`: the placeholder text for the field.
    - `value`: the default value for the field.
    - `required`: whether the field is required.
    - `style`: the style of the field (1 for short, 2 for long).
    - `min_length`: the minimum length of the field.
    - `max_length`: the maximum length of the field.

Alternatively, you can create a modal object using the [`cmodal`](#cmodal) function.

##### Example

```yag
{{ $modal := sdict
  "title" "My Custom Modal"
  "custom_id" "modals-my_first_modal"
  "fields" (cslice
    (sdict "label" "Name" "placeholder" "Duck" "required" true)
    (sdict "label" "Do you like ducks?" "value" "Heck no")
    (sdict "label" "Duck hate essay" "min_length" 100 "style")) }}
{{ sendModal $modal }}
```

#### updateMessage

```yag
{{ updateMessage <newMessage> }}
```

Edits the message on which the button, select menu, or modal was triggered on.

- `newMessage`: the new message content. May be a string, an embed, or a complex message.

##### Example

The following example must be triggered by a component or modal submission.

```yag
{{ $button := cbutton "label" "I won!" "custom_id" "i_won" }}
{{ $content := printf "Press this button when you win! The last person who won was %s! They wanted to say they are a %s %s." .User.Mention adjective noun }}

{{ $message := complexMessageEdit "content" $content "buttons" $button }}
{{ updateMessage $message }}
```


#### updateMessageNoEscape

```yag
{{ updateMessageNoEscape <newMessage> }}
```

Same as [updateMessage](#updatemessage), plus it does not escape mentions.

### Interaction Followups

- Interaction followups may be sent up to 15 minutes after an interaction.
- To send a followup, you must have the interaction token of the interaction you are following up.
- You can send as many followups as you'd like.
- Text output directly to the response is automatically sent as an interaction followup if the interaction has
  already been responded to.
- A followup is not the same thing as a response.

#### editResponse

```yag
{{ editResponse <interactionToken> <messageID> <newContent> }}
```

Edits a response to an interaction.

- `interactionToken`: the token of the interaction to edit. `nil` for the triggering interaction.
- `messageID`: the ID of a follow-up message. `nil` for the original interaction response.
- `newContent`: the new content for the message.

##### Example

The following example must be triggered by a component trigger or modal submission.

```yag
{{ $token := .Interaction.Token }}

{{ sendResponse nil "Here's the first message!" }}
{{ $id := sendResponseRetID $token (complexMessage "content" "Here's a sneaky one!" "ephemeral" true) }}

{{ sleep 2 }}

{{ editResponse $token $id (print "I've edited this message to say " noun) }}
{{ $editedResponse := getResponse $token $id }}
{{ editResponse $token nil $editedResponse.Content }}
```

#### editResponseNoEscape

```yag
{{ editResponseNoEscape <interactionToken> <messageID> <newContent> }}
```

Same as [editResponse](#editresponse), plus it does not escape mentions.

#### Interaction Response/Followup Hybrids

Hybrid functions will send an interaction response if the interaction has not already been responded to, otherwise
they will send the equivalent followup function. See [editResponse](#editresponse) for an example using
`sendResponse*` functions.

#### sendResponse

```yag
{{ sendResponse <interactionToken> <message> }}
```

Sends a message in response to an interaction. Supports the `ephemeral` flag in `complexMessage`.

#### sendResponseNoEscape

```yag
{{ sendResponseNoEscape <interactionToken> <message> }}
```

Same as [sendResponse](#sendresponse), plus it does not escape mentions.

#### sendResponseNoEscapeRetID

```yag
{{ sendResponseNoEscapeRetID <interactionToken> <message> }}
```

Same as [sendResponseNoEscape](#sendresponsenoescape), but also returns the message ID.

#### sendResponseRetID

```yag
{{ sendResponseRetID <interactionToken> <message> }}
```

Same as [sendResponse](#sendresponse), but also returns the message ID.

### Interaction Miscellaneous

#### cbutton

```yag
{{ $button := cbutton "list of button values" }}
```

Creates a [button object](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#button-object) for use in
interactions.

A link style button *must* have a URL and may not have a Custom ID. All other styles *must* have a Custom ID and cannot
have a URL. All buttons must have either a label or an emoji.

##### Example

```yag
{{ $button := cbutton "label" "Button" "custom_id" "buttons-duck" }}
{{ $message := complexMessage "buttons" $button }}
{{ sendMessage nil $message }}
```

#### cmenu

```yag
{{ $menu := cmenu "list of select menu values" }}
```

Creates a [select menu object](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#select-menu-object)
for use in interactions.

The type should be provided as a string: `"text"`, `"user"`, `"role"`, `"mentionable"`, or `"channel"`. Text type menus
*must* have `options`, while all other types cannot.

##### Example

```yag
{{ $menu := cmenu
  "type" "text"
  "placeholder" "Choose a terrible thing"
  "custom_id" "menus-duck"
  "options" (cslice
    (sdict "label" "Two Ducks" "value" "opt-1" "default" true)
    (sdict "label" "A Duck" "value" "duck-option" "emoji" (sdict "name" "🦆"))
    (sdict "label" "Half a Duck" "value" "third-option" "description" "Don't let the smaller amount fool you."))
  "max_values" 3 }}

{{ sendMessage nil (complexMessage "menus" $menu) }}
```

#### cmodal

```yag
{{ $modal := cmodal "list of modal values" }}
```

Creates a [modal object][modals] for use in interactions. See [`sendModal`](#sendmodal) for more detail.

[modals]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-modal

#### deleteInteractionResponse

```yag
{{ deleteInteractionResponse <interactionToken> <messageID> [delay] }}
```

Deletes the specified response or follow-up message.

- `interactionToken`: a valid interaction token or `nil` for the triggering interaction.
- `messageID`: valid message ID of a follow-up, or `nil` for the original interaction response.
- `delay`: an optional delay in seconds, max 10 seconds. Default: 10 seconds.

If you require a delay of more than 10 seconds, consider using `execCC` for deletion of an ephemeral response, or
`deleteMessage` to delete a regular interaction response.

#### ephemeralResponse

```yag
{{ ephemeralResponse }}
```

Tells the bot to send the response text as an ephemeral message. Only works when triggered by an interaction. Works on
responses and follow-ups.

##### Example

```yag
{{ ephemeralResponse }}

This text is invisible to others!
```

#### getResponse

```yag
{{ $response := getResponse <interactionToken> <messageID> }}
```

Returns the response or follow-up with the specified message ID belonging to the given interaction as a [message
object](/docs/reference/templates/syntax-and-data#message). Is also valid for ephemeral messages.

[perms]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions

##### Example

To calculate the permission in a channel other than the current channel, for which we could just use the
[hasPermissions](#haspermissions) or [targetHasPermissions](#targethaspermissions) function, we will have to use bitwise
operations:

```yag
{{ $perms := getTargetPermissionsIn .User.ID $someChannel }}
{{ $mask := bitwiseAnd .Permissions.ManageRoles $perms }}
{{ if eq $mask .Permissions.ManageRoles }}
  You have the permissions to manage roles!
{{ else }}
  You do not have the permissions to manage roles!
{{ end }}
```

#### hasPermissions

```yag
{{ $hasPerms := hasPermissions <permission> }}
```

Returns whether the member who triggered the command has the specified permission bit.
See [`.Permissions`](/docs/reference/templates/syntax-and-data/#context-data) for more information.

##### Example

```yag
{{ if hasPermissions .Permissions.Administrator }}
  You have the Administrator permission!
{{ else }}
  You do not have the Administrator permission.

```yag
{{ mentionHere }}
```

Mentions `@here` without escaping it.

```yag
{{ mentionRoleID <roleID> }}
```

Mentions the given role without escaping it.

#### mentionRoleName

```yag
{{ mentionRoleName <roleName> }}
```

Concatenates `args...` in order, inserting the given `separator` between consecutive arguments and returns the result.
As a special case, slices of strings are formatted as if each element was provided separately, so

```yag
{{ joinStr " " (cslice "cat" "dog") }}
```

yields `cat dog`.

See also [printf](#printf) if you just want to concatenate arguments without a separator.

#### lower

```yag
{{ $result := lower <string> }}
```

Converts `string` to all lowercase and returns the result.

#### print

#### reFindAllSubmatches

```yag
{{ $result := reFindAllSubmatches <regex> <text> [count] }}
```

Returns a slice of successive submatches of `regex` in `text`. Each submatch is itself a slice containing the match of

follows; see the [Go `time` package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) for the full list.

| Placeholder | Meaning                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Mon         | Weekday (abbreviated)        |
| Monday      | Weekday (full name)          |
| 2           | Day of month (single digit)  |
| 02          | Day of month (zero padded)   |
| Jan         | Month (abbreviated)          |
| January     | Month (full name)            |
| 1           | Month (single digit)         |
| 01          | Month (zero padded)          |
| 15          | Hour (24-hour format)        |
| 3           | Hour (12-hour format)        |
| 04          | Minute (zero padded)         |
| 05          | Second (zero padded)         |
| MST         | Timezone (abbreviated)       |
| 2006        | Year (full year)             |
| PM          | AM-PM                        |

#### humanizeDurationHours

```yag
{{ $formatted := humanizeDurationHours <duration> }}
```

#### humanizeDurationMinutes

```yag
{{ $formatted := humanizeDurationMinutes <duration> }}
```

Returns `duration` as a human-readable string, rounded down to the nearest minute.

#### humanizeDurationSeconds

```yag
{{ $formatted := humanizeDurationSeconds <duration> }}
```

Returns `duration` as a human-readable string, rounded down to the nearest second.

#### humanizeTimeSinceDays

```yag
{{ $formatted := humanizeTimeSinceDays <time> }}
```

day.

#### loadLocation

```yag
{{ $location := loadLocation "location" }}
```

Searches the IANA Time Zone database for the given location name, returning the corresponding location object on
success. (Given a time object `$time`, `$time.In $location` then returns a copy of the time set in the given location
for display purposes.)

As a special case, providing `UTC`, or the empty string `""`, yields the UTC location. Providing `Local` yields the
local time zone of the host YAGPDB server.

#### newDate

```yag
{{ $time := newDate <year> <month> <day> <hour> <minute> <second> [location] }}
```

Returns the time object corresponding to

```
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
```

In the appropriate zone for that time in the given location.


The month, day, hour, min, and sec values may be outside their usual ranges and will be normalized during the
conversion. For example, October 32 converts to November 1.

A daylight savings time transition skips or repeats times. For example, in the United States, March 13, 2011 2:15am
never occurred, while November 6, 2011 1:15am occurred twice. In such cases, the choice of time zone, and therefore
the time, is not well-defined. `newDate` returns a time that is correct in one of the two zones involved in the
transition, but it does not guarantee which.

#### parseTime

```yag
{{ $time := parseTime <input> <layout> [location] }}
```

Undos the operation performed by [`formatTime`](#formattime): that is, given some `input` string representing a time
using the given `layout`, `parseTime` returns the corresponding time object in the specified location, or UTC by
default. If the input is invalid or does not follow `layout`, the zero time is returned.

A slice of layouts may be provided, in which case the input is matched against each in order until one matches or the
end of the slice is reached.

#### snowflakeToTime

```yag
{{ $time := snowflakeToTime <snowflake> }}
```

Returns the UTC time at which the given Discord snowflake was created.

#### timestampToTime

```yag
{{ $time := timestampToTime <unixSeconds> }}
```

Returns the UTC time corresponding to the given UNIX time, measured in seconds since January 1, 1970.

#### weekNumber

```yag
{{ $week := weekNumber <time> }}
```

Returns the ISO 8601 week number in which the time occurs, ranging between 1 and 53. Jan 01 to Jan 03 of year n might
belong to week 52 or 53 of year n-1, and Dec 29 to Dec 31 might belong to week 1 of year n+1.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

Discord Timestamp Styles referenced on
[Discord message documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting-timestamp-styles) can be done using `print`
function e.g.

`{{print "<t:" currentTime.Unix ":F>"}}` for "Long Date/Time" formatting.

- `user`: the user to get the warnings for. Can be either a user ID or a user object.

#### humanizeThousands

```yag
{{ $formatted := humanizeThousands <number> }}
```

Places commas to separate groups of thousands in a number.

- `number`: the number to format. Must be an int or a string. Must be a whole number.

#### inFold

```yag
{{ $result := inFold <list> <value> }}
```

Same as [in](#in), but is case-insensitive.

#### in

```yag
{{ $result := in <list> <value> }}
```

Returns whether the case-sensitive `value` is in the provided list.

#### index

```yag
{{ $item := index <list> <index> }}
```

Returns the item at the specified index in `list`.

`list` is zero-indexed, so the first item is at index 0. `list` can be a slice, map, or string.

If you are indexing a map (that is, `dict` or `sdict`), `index` must be matching the key (as maps are unordered).
Indexing a string type returns the character at that position as a rune.

You may optionally add additional indices in case you have nested structures, like `index $x 0 1`. This is equivalent to
chaining `index` calls, e.g. `index (index $x 0) 1`.

#### kindOf

```
{{ $kind := kindOf <value> [indirect] }}
```

Returns the [kind](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#Kind) of the provided value.

If `value` is behind an `interface{}` or pointer, set `indirect` to true to read the inner value. Most users of this
function will want to do this.

#### len

```yag
{{ $length := len <list> }}
```

Returns the length of the provided list. `list` can be a slice, map, or string.

#### noun

```yag
{{ $noun := noun }}
```

Returns a random noun.

#### parseArgs

```yag
{{ $args := parseArgs <requiredArgs> <errorMessage> [...cargs] }}
```

Parses arguments passed to the custom command. Ensures that at least `requiredArgs` are passed and checks that these
arguments match as specified by `carg...`, emits `errorMessage` otherwise.

Passing an empty string as `errorMessage` will generate one for you based on the provided argument definitions.

The result has the `.Get N` and `.IsSet N` methods available, returning the value or reporting whether the argument is
present, respectively, at position `N` (starting from 0).

- `...cargs`: a list of argument definitions. Must have at least `requiredArgs` elements. Has the following arguments:
  - `"type"`: the type of this argument as a quoted string.
  - `"name"`: the name of this argument. Must be a string.

An argument's `"type"` must be one of the following:

- `int` (whole number)
- `float` (decimal number)
- `string` (text)
- `user` (user mentions, resolves to the [user](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/reference/templates#user) structure)
- `userid` (mentions or user IDs, resolves to the ID itself)
- `member` (mentions or user IDs, resolves to the [member](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/reference/templates#member)
  structure)
- `channel` (channel mention or ID, resolves to the channel structure)
- `role` (role name or ID, resolves as type \*discordgo.Role)
- `duration` (duration that is human-readable, i.e `10h5m` or `10 hour 5 minutes` would both resolve to the same
  duration)

Additionally, the `int`, `float`, and `duration` type support validation ranges in the interval `(min, max)`, where for
`duration` it is in seconds.

##### Example

```yag
{{ $args := parseArgs 1 "" (carg "int" "coolness level" 0 100) (carg "member" "target member") }}
Coolness: {{ $args.Get 0 }}
{{- if $args.IsSet 1 }}
Target: {{ ($args.Get 1).User }}
{{- else }}
Target: {{ .User }}
{{ end }}
```

#### sdict

```yag
{{ $map := sdict [values...] }}
```

Creates a dictionary from the provided key-value pairs. The number of parameters must be even. The keys must be of
string type.


#### sendTemplateDM

```yag
{{ $messageID := sendTemplateDM "template" [data] }}
```

Same as [sendTemplate](#sendtemplate), but sends it to the triggering user's direct messages instead and returns the
*response* message's ID.

#### sendTemplate

```yag
{{ $messageID := sendTemplate <channel> "template" [data] }}
```

Sends an [Associated Template](/docs/reference/templates/syntax-and-data#associated-templates) to `channel`, with
optional `data`, returning the *response* message's ID.

#### seq

```yag
{{ $sequence := seq <start> <stop> }}
```

Creates a new slice with integer-type elements, starting from `start` and ending at `stop-1`. `start` and `stop` must be
whole numbers. Limited to 10,000 elements.

#### shuffle

```yag
{{ $shuffled := shuffle <list> }}
```

Returns a shuffled (randomized) version of the provided list.

#### sleep

```yag
{{ sleep <seconds> }}
```

Pauses the execution of the custom command for the specified number of seconds. The maximum duration is 60 seconds,
combined across all `sleep` calls within the custom command and its associated templates.

#### slice

```yag
{{ $result := slice <item> <start> [end] }}
```

Returns a subslice of the input `item` (which may be an array, slice, or string) containing the elements starting at
index `start` (inclusive), and ending at index `end`, exclusive. If only `start` is provided, it is interpreted as the
start index and the subslice extends to the end of `item`.

#### sort

```yag
{{ $sorted := <list> [options] }}
```

Returns the given list in a sorted order. The list's items must all be of the same type. The optional `options` argument
is an sdict with the following (optional) keys:
- `key`: if sorting a list of maps, the key's value to sort by. This key must be present on all maps in the slice.
- `reverse`: whether to sort in reverse (descending) order. Default: `false`.

Limited to 1 call on regular servers and 3 calls on premium servers.

#### verb

```yag
{{ $verb := verb }}
```

Returns a random verb.
