![Voice Roles overview](voice_roles_overview.png)

Voice Roles is a feature that allows you to automatically assign a specific role to a user when they join a voice channel or a stage channel. The role is automatically removed when the user leaves the channel.

This is useful for:
- Giving users special permissions or a unique look while they are in a voice channel.
- Tracking who is currently active in voice.
- Creating channel-specific roles.


To configure Voice Roles, navigate to the **Voice Roles** section in the dashboard, under the **Roles** tab.

1. Select a Voice/Stage channel and a role to assign to users who join the channel.

2. **Save changes**: Ensure you save your settings.

You can have 1 active voice role per server for free, and with [premium](https://yagpdb.xyz/premium), you can have upto 10 active voice roles.
