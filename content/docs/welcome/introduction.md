> Documentation is for users. - Rob Pike

This is the documentation for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz); this document in its current form is a work in progress, as
it is an attempt to move away from the current documentation hosted via GitBook.

This page is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in conjunction with the [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org) as an
experiment to see if it is a viable alternative.

## Other Resources

### Support Server

If you need help with YAGPDB, please join the [support server](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5) and ask in the appropriate
channel. Any other online forum is not official and should be generally treated as inaccurate.

Questions regarding the clarity of this documentation are also welcome, as they help us improve the documentation.

Remember to first read `#information` and `#faq` before asking questions. Our support staff are volunteers, so please be
patient when they don't respond in 10<sup>-3</sup> seconds, they are probably busy with something else.

### Learning Center

If you are new to YAGPDB's custom command system, you might want to check out the
[Learning Center](/learn/welcome/introduction) for a more structured approach to learning how to write custom commands.

However, it is not a replacement for the documentation, so you will need to read both to actually write custom commands.

## Supporting YAGPDB

### Premium

If you want to financially support YAGPDB, you can do so by donating to the project via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/yagpdb).
Please note that premium functionality is just a bonus for supporting the project and not a product.

### Helping Out

Please do not shy away from helping other users in the [support server](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5) if you believe you
can help them. This is a great way to give back to the community and help the project grow.

### Contributing

<!-- TODO: maybe add a guide for selfhosting? -->

#### Improving the Bot

Additionally, you can contribute to YAGPDB itself by submitting pull requests to its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb) if you are feeling comfortable with [Go](https://golang.org/).

Please take a closer look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to increase the chances of your pull request being accepted; a good starting point is also to implement highly-upvoted
suggestions in the `#suggestions` channel on the support server.

#### Writing Documentation

If you feel that contributing to the bot itself is a bit too daunting, you are just as welcome to write and improve this
documentation. All you really need is a decent (text) editor of your choice and a good look at our [docs contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb-docs-v2/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
