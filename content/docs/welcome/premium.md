YAGPDB provides added functionality to servers which are assigned a premium slot by a user. On the official instance of

{{< callout context="danger" title="Danger: Disabled Features" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}

Some features enhanced or enabled by premium have been disabled on Botlabs' publicly hosted instance, often due to
ratelimits with 3rd party APIs YAGPDB relies on.

Any features marked as **DISABLED ON OFFICIAL INSTANCE** will **not** be available if you become a Patron to Botlabs.

## Enabling Premium on a Server

### Getting a Premium Slot

To enable premium on your server, you'll first need to get a premium slot assigned to your account. This is tied to your
Discord user ID and cannot be transferred.

#### Patreon

We have a [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/yagpdb) where you can pledge to support YAGPDB and get premium
slots in return. This is the only way to purchase more than one premium slot.

1. Pledge the required minimum amount to unlock a premium slot.
2. [Link your Patreon account][p-link] to your Discord account.
3. Wait for up to 5 minutes for YAGPDB to verify your Patreon status.
4. If slot(s) still do not appear, you may need to unlink and relink your Patreon and Discord account again.

#### Discord Store

If you prefer not to use Patreon, you can purchase **a single premium slot** directly from [our Discord Store][d-store].
Simply click on "Subscribe" and follow the on-screen instructions to complete your purchase---it may take up to 30
minutes until the slot is available for assignment to a server on the [premium page](https://yagpdb.xyz/premium).

If you wish to purchase multiple slots, you will need to go through Patreon as explained above.

[d-store]: https://discord.com/application-directory/204255083083333633/store

#### From a Code

A bot owner may generate temporary or permanent premium codes for giveaways, perks, or to manually reward donors who
donate through other sources/when the Patreon API is down.

1. Visit [/premium](https://yagpdb.xyz/premium).
2. Paste your code into the "Redeem Code" field, and click "Redeem Code." You may also use the "Check Code" button to
   see a code's validity and expiration without claiming it yourself.

### Assigning a Slot

Once you have obtained a Premium slot, it should appear on the [/premium](https://yagpdb.xyz/premium) page and be
available to be assigned to a server. For each slot, choose a server to assign it to, then click "Update Premium Slot."

You can assign your premium slots to any server with YAGPDB in it and no existing slot assigned.

## Self Hosting YAGPDB

Do not proceed unless you are hosting your own version of the YAGPDB codebase.

### Premium Sources

When hosting YAGPDB yourself, you have access to a few methods to source premium slots to your users.

- Patreon

  1. Configure your price per premium slot in `premium/patreonpremiumsource/patreonpremiumsource.go > func
    CalcSlotsForPledge`.
  2. Configure relevant env variables to connect YAGPDB to your Patreon API.

- Generating premium codes with the `GeneratePremiumCode` command.
- Setting the `premium.all_guilds_premium` env variable to true.

### Changing Limits

Functionally raising or lowering limits, both for premium and non-premium servers, is accomplished by altering the
source code. Most limits are numerical values that only need to be updated in one location. For most of the above listed
numerical limits, the relevant key or constant is named in parenthesis. Ex. (`MaxMessageTriggersPremium`). It is
recommended you familiarize yourself with the codebase before making changes. Find where these keys or constants are
defined and alter their values as you wish.
