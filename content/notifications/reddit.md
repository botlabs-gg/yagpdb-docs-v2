## Reddit Feed

![Small showcase of the Reddit feeds interface.](./reddit.png)

To get notifications from a subreddit, simply enter the name of the subreddit in the subreddit field without the `r/` in
front (for example, to add a feed for the `r/jonas747`, you would put "jonas747" as the subreddit name). Then, specify
which channel you would like the bot to post the feed in.

You can toggle whether to post using embeds or without using them. With embeds, the feed will look nicer but videos and
such will not be attached but just linked.
